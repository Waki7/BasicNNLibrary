# BasicNNLibrary
THIS IS AN OLD REPO RIDDLED THAT'S RIDDLED WITH ERRORS. I think the organization was somewhat interesting, just a super naive neural network library probably with some incorrect calculations. 

Just wanted to separate it from other code, it's interesting to me to look back at it. At the time, I was more or less using it to learn and play around with stuff.
